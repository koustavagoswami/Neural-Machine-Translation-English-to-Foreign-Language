# Neural-Machine-Translation-English-to-Foreign-Language
In this Project I have used encoder - decoder model with attention 
and without attention to build a system which is capable of translating 
source language to target language. For my work I have taken English to France translation. 
My target language is French and Source Language is English.

The Code is capable of taking any input file. The only thing is the file should consists of Source and Target language in same .txt file
and those should be tab seperated.
In my case I have used English to French translation and the download link for the file is given in the notebook.

The code has been written in python.

The attention model is the global attention model which has been described in the notebook itself.
